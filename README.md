# Machine Learning Algorithms

## What is This
This repository will basically include a variety of different machine learning algorithms that are implemented from scratch.

Visualizations with graph plots might be included for some of the algorithms.

## What is Completed
Currently, this repository contains the implementation of:
- Linear Regression (Single & Multivariable, via Gradient Descent and Normal Equation)
