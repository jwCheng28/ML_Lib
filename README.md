# Machine Learning Algorithms

### What is this Repository:
This is a personal project where the intent is to implement a variety of different machine learning algorithms from scratch.

As I personally think that implementing these algorithms from scratch is a very good way to understand what is actually happening behind these algorithms.

Graph plots visualization (ex. Training set & h function, Cost over iterations) are also included for most of the algorithms.

### What is Completed:
Currently, this repository contains the implementation of:
- Linear Regression (Single & Multivariable, via Gradient Descent and Normal Equation)
- Polynomial Regression
- Logistic Regression

### What is Needed:
Below are the required versions of Python and Python Libraries needed for the code to run succesfully:
```
- python 3.6.10     
- numpy 1.18.5       (Used for matrix calculations)
- matplotlib 3.2.2   (Used for plotting graphs)
- sklearn 0.23.1     (Used for importing random datasets)
 ```
